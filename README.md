# UEFI-based Arch Linux builds for AAARCH64 (Apple M1/M2)) UTM and x86_64 VirtualBox platforms

This repository contains build instructions for custom Arch Linux for multi-platform and multi-architecture.
Supported builds include Arch Linux with Black Arch repositories for 
    
* AAARCH64 with UTM/QEMU support
* x86_64 with VirtualBox support

A specific Arch Linux will be built and the publishing process for the csc.fi platform is documented.

As an alternative to popular Kali Linux, Parrot OS and Black Arch virtual machines, we have a bit more lightweight and opinionated virtual machine.


Since students will have various machines, and many will also use new ARM-based Macbooks, there is a need for multi-architecture virtual machines.
